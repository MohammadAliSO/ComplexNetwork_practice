## Part2  
* Implementation of different networks with Centellities.

## Part3 
* SpectralClustering on FaceBook & KaratehClub Networks.

## Part4  
* Given image a) a.png , separate foregrounⅾ and baⅽkgrounⅾ using clustering. Then compare with image b (b.png) and report the accuracy.
(Hint: Pixels are your data and its features are the values in them. Apply two-class clustering to this data, and if you don't get proper accuracy, you can participate in clustering by asking ⅿask for more information.

## Part5  
* Consider the Karate Klay network:    
  1- Use the Laplacian Eigenmap and Node2Vec methods and cut to dimensions 4 and 5. Then perform K-Means and  hierarchical methods on the data.  
  2- Move the data to the 2nd dimension with the mentioned methods and display it.
