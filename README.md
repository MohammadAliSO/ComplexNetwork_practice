## Part2  
* Implementation of different networks with Centellities.

## Part3 
* SpectralClustering on FaceBook & KaratehClub Networks.

## Part4  
* Given image a) a.png , separate foregrounⅾ and baⅽkgrounⅾ using clustering. Then compare with image b (b.png) and report the accuracy.
(Hint: Pixels are your data and its features are the values in them. Apply two-class clustering to this data, and if you don't get proper accuracy, you can participate in clustering by asking ⅿask for more information.

## Part5  
* Consider the Karate club network:    
  1- Use the Laplacian Eigenmap and Node2Vec methods and cut to dimensions 4 and 5. Then perform K-Means and  hierarchical methods on the data.  
  2- Move the data to the 2nd dimension with the mentioned methods and display it.  
  
## Part6  
* A. Train a network that includes graph convolutional layers and a bound class. So that by using graph layers, he obtains representation vectors of length 2 for the vertices of the KarateClub graph and then classifies them with a class clause.  
* B. Increase the number of graphic layers in the above model (at least 20 layers) and check the result (by visual comparison or numerical criteria).  
* C. In the KarateClub graph available in datasets.geometric_torch, the hot one encoding method is used for the initial display vectors of the vertices. By adding (concatenate) the vectors resulting from the Laplacian eigenmap method to the initial display vectors, define new display vectors for the vertices of the graph and repeat parts A and B with new data and check the result.
